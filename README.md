Connect to API

Practise what we've learned in the past few days by making a small React app which connects to an API. This could be similar to the countries app we made that has a dropdown menu which when selected displays some information about that option. You could also select from a list of api's below or be creative connect to an API of your choice.

Remember to have a container and component folder. Containers will handle data requests, state changes and callbacks. Components will handle visualisation logic (and only have access to props).

### Harry Potter API

`http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/`

E.g. List all of the characters and click to see more info. You could extend this by filtering by Hogwarts House.
